# C++ Neural Network
 
This is my handmade neural network library in C++.

- I'm currently working on it, so it's not finished yetã€‚
- No external libraries are used, only the **standard I/O library and the math library**.

### Current achievements
- MNIST: 96.64%

I've not learnt special optimization methods yet, so it's low compared to your pytorch or tensorflow.
